# DNAlearn

DNAlearn is a recommender system for DNA sequence optimization. Users who want to model their high-througput DNA sequencing results can do so easily with DNAlearn. 

DNAlearn builds and tunes an optimal convolutional neural network (CNN) to model DNA sequencing data. Using this model, DNAlearn recommends an optimized sequence - predicted to maximize experimental output.
